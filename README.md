# Made with Python using Tensorflow, NLTK and Numpy.

### Its purpose is to have a free conversation with the user.

It operates by:
- accepting a sentence from the user, 
- processes the natural language within it, 
- and employs neural networks to determine the most suitable response.

Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and bag-of-words are utilized for this purpose.
